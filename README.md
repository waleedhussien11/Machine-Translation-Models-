## Introduction

Translation models have made significant strides in recent years, providing accurate and efficient translations across various languages. This project compares four popular translation models: BERT, Helsinki-NLP's Opus-MT, T5, and Google Translate. The goal is to evaluate their performance on a standardized dataset and provide insights into their strengths and weaknesses.

## Models

### BERT

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a transformer-based model designed to understand the context of a word in search queries. While not primarily designed for translation, BERT can be fine-tuned for various NLP tasks, including translation.

### Helsinki-NLP Opus-MT

Helsinki-NLP's Opus-MT models are pre-trained translation models available for many language pairs. They are based on the Marian NMT framework and are designed to provide high-quality translations.

### T5

T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) is a transformer model that treats every NLP problem as a text-to-text problem. It has shown impressive performance in various tasks, including translation.

### Google Translate

Google Translate is a widely used machine translation service developed by Google. It uses advanced neural machine translation models and has been continually improved over the years.
